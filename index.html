            <h1>About Me</h1>
             <img class="selfie" src="images/IMG_0405.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>My name is Tim Sherry, I used to go by TJ, but decided to rebrand myself after my 25th birthday to something I felt was more mature. 
                I was born and raised here in Orlando, FL and have loved every second of it, but I do think it is time for me to venture out and see what else is out there.
                I consider myself a simple man because things like steak and whiskey excite me the most now. In my free time I like to watch movies or read books about anything fantasy. 
                I do occasionally enjoy video games but nothing multiplayer anymore just games like RDR2 or Skyrim.
                When I was younger I played many sports like Basketball, Football and I aslo ran Track but now I enjoy watching Boxing or Hockey instead.</p>
                        
            <p>I charish family values, I am the oldest of 3 but hope my wife will be open to starting a family larger than the one I grew up with someday.
                I am interested in Software Development and the potential of landing a job in this field becasuse I do enjoy buidling things, and the entire world is going digital and there is a constant demand for individuals with this trade.
                So if there is money going around, I want some of it too!</p>
